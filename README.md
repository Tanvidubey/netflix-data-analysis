### üìåInsights

- **The dataset comprises 8,807 rows and 12 columns.**
- **The movie release years in the dataset range from a minimum of 1925 to a maximum of 2021, indicating that it covers movies from 1925 to 2021.**

# Data Preprocessing

1. Check for Errors and Null Values
2. Replace Null Values with appropriate values
3. Drop down features that are incomplete and are not too relevant for analysis
4. Create new features that can would help to improve prediction

```python
#checking row wise duplicate records
netflix[netflix.duplicated()]
```

|  | show_id | type | title | director | cast | country | date_added | release_year | rating | duration | listed_in | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

```python
#check for null values
miss=netflix.isnull().sum()
miss_percent= round((netflix.isnull().sum()/len(netflix))*100,2)
miss_data=pd.concat([miss,miss_percent],axis=1,keys=['Total','%'])
print(miss_data)
```

- **The `director` column contains approximately 30% null values.**
- **The `cast` column has 9.37% null values.**
- **The columns `country`, `date_added`, `rating`, and `duration` have minimal missing values.**
- **There are no duplicate rows in this dataset.**
- For missing values in country we will replace with the most common country(mode)
- For cast and director will just add "No Data"

```python
netflix['country'] = netflix['country'].fillna(netflix['country'].mode()[0])
```

```python
netflix['cast'].replace(np.nan,'No Data',inplace=True)
netflix['director'].replace(np.nan,'No Data',inplace=True)
```

## New Feature:

- extract the day and month from the 'date_added' column to make it easier to analyze trends over time.
- Create a new column for genre to extract insights.
- Convert the 'date_added' column to datetime format.
- Drop unnecessary columns

```python
# Convert 'date_added' to date time format with 'coerce' to handle and replace invalid dates.
netflix['date_added'] = pd.to_datetime(netflix['date_added'],errors='coerce')
```

```python
# Extracted month,month_name,day  information from the 'date_added' column
netflix['month_added'] = netflix['date_added'].dt.month
netflix['month_name_added'] = netflix['date_added'].dt.month_name()
netflix['day_added'] = netflix['date_added'].dt.day_name()
```

```python
netflix.head(1)
